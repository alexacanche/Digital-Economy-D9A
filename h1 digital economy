## ESSAY 

Technology has always been at the service of man. While it was once considered a secondary part of work, the industrial revolutions and the rapid advance of computer innovations have placed it in a place that is now recognized as primordial. Don Tapscott [1] talks about the Age of Networked Intelligence, since it is not only about the connection between computers and intelligent devices, but also about people, their information and the way we interact with machines. 

The digital economy, contrary to popular belief, not only tries to cover issues related to money and its flow through computer networks, but also how, little by little, companies undergo changes that require the adoption of technologies to survive in a hyperconnected world. 

But to talk about the economy is also to talk about people and society in general. If companies decide to adopt technologies and go digital, it is partly because society requires it. [2] So it is essential to emphasize that people are also in a constant change and adoption of systems that allow this system to grow more and more. The crises and lack of jobs in nearby places for some people represent problems that can be solved by computer systems, highlighting how technology can help in social problems. 

Among many other uses of information technology, it can help us in difficult times. The role of technology in crises has undoubtedly been important. One example of this is through the implementation of technology-based strategies for companies to make their internal and production processes more efficient. Suppose, for example, that a company wants to maximize its profits by automating certain business processes, or by employing intelligent solutions instead of delegating them to a human. These types of implementations, while they may not seem to have a big impact, are of great help to those organizations affected by crises and that depend on more efficiency to move forward. Of course, these are behaviors we would expect to see in smaller organizations with previous efficiency problems. [2] 

Another example of how technology can help to overcome a crisis and difficult times are trading bots, which aim to predict the future behavior of a company's stock market, to give an example. These bots were created under the premise that, since in economics predictions are a combination of calculations and statistical predictions, there would be no human capable of beating the computing power of computer systems. Although these bots have not been found to be more efficient than market calculations per se, companies often use computer systems to predict future economic behavior. Clear examples of these are regressions, which are used to predict future behavior based on past experience. 

In the same line, the concept of Industry 4.0 emerged, and it refers to a new way of producing through the adoption of 4.0 technologies, in other words, solutions focused on interconnectivity, automation and real-time data processing and analysis. 

This transformation not only encompasses the production of goods and/or services of companies, but also involves the entire value chain, since it reconfigures the manufacturing processes and product performance, as well as business management, customer and supplier relations and, more generally, business models. 

For a company to be part of Industry 4.0, it must transform the way in which it conceives itself, so a paradigm shift in its operation is necessary, which must initiate a process of gradual incorporation of different novel technological components, coming from the digital and physical domains.  

Some of these components are: Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Robotics, 3D Printing, Cloud Services and Cybersecurity. 

Why a company would adopt these types of technologies and make the transition to Industry 4.0 is more than justified by the multiple benefits it brings, such as improved productivity and efficiency in the use of resources, the generation of useful information for real-time decision making and medium and long-term planning, allowing the creation of new products and services that improve the user experience from this information collected, and finally, efficiently integrating all the actors involved in the manufacturing process. 

This digital transformation is not only changing our economy, but also the nature of labor markets and workforces caused by the irruption of robots and AI will change the labor market.  

Automation has destroyed jobs before it created new ones in any sector of the economy. The difference is that previous revolutions brought to civilization physical strength or dexterity, while now the capabilities go much further, because they are cognitive. 

The processes of change are intertwined with all spheres of society: social security systems, culture and education, citizen security, infrastructure, etc. Democracy and participation are the key structural features in this society and this includes the world of work. It affects all factors surrounding society: the economy, tourism, trade, information, recruitment, public administration, training, logistics, security, etc., leading to the removal of physical barriers. 


 

## QUESTIONS 

 
What is digital economy? The digital economy is the economic activity that results from billions of everyday online connections among people, businesses, devices, data, and processes. 

What is the backbone of digital economy? The backbone of the digital economy is hyperconnectivity which means growing interconnectedness of people, organizations, and machines that results from the Internet, mobile technology, and the internet of things (IoT). 

How does digital transformation affect society? (Open questions, answers may vary): First, digital technologies dramatically change the ways in which individuals, firms and governments interact. In addition, overall impacts are often not clear-cut and may vary across countries. 

How did the musical industry originally see internet? they viewed the Internet as a threat rather than the biggest opportunity to come along in their history. 

How should the internet have been seen by the musical industry? The Internet should have been a godsend for music labels. By sidestepping the Industrial Age infrastructure, many more musicians could be profitable. Record companies—reinvented as digital networks of artists, fans, and entrepreneurs—could nurture many small artists, rather than focus all their energies on potential superstars. 

What has been proven to be the correct approach to internet by the musical industry? Music should stop being a product that one buys and instead be a service that one subscribes to for a small monthly fee. 

How does Thomas Piketty justify that growing inequality is built into the capitalism? He argues that capital (wealth) and inequality are likely to grow in the next few decades and that rather than seeing the broad and mutual prosperity we have come to assumes the natural state of advanced economies, the influence of wealth will make our economy look a lot more like the nineteenth century, dominated by massive fortunes. 

What are the problems of “industrial capitalism”?  All around us we see industries in crisis and governments that can’t get things done. Media companies are failing and the financial services sector is increasingly reckless. Our energy grid and transportation systems need urgent renewal. Institutions for global cooperation and problem solving seem incapable of progress. 

What is capitalism 2.0? rather than social (state) ownership of everything, it would be a society where innovation is driven by companies and market forces. Under capitalism there is private ownership of wealth, and most goods and services are produced by firms, most of which are corporations. 

How did IBM benefit from the open-source community? By embracing Linux, which is an open-source operating system, saving themselves hundreds of millions of dollars a year and generating billions of dollars in hardware and services revenue. 

What is the advantage of sharing intellectual property? It represents a way to improve their industries and their own chances of survival within the economic world. 

How are governments still important under Capitalism 2.0? Governments can become a stronger part of the social ecosystem that binds individuals, communities, and businesses—not by absorbing new responsibilities or building additional layers of bureaucracy, but through a willingness to open up formerly closed processes and data to broader input and innovation. 

What are the four key pillars of society? business, government, the civic sector, and the new pillar enabled by the Internet—the individual citizen. 

What would be the approach of Capitalism 2.0 to regulations? Business leaders would embrace good regulation, understanding that markets work best with strong foundations and good regulations. 

Why is it important to help society share wealth better? We cannot accept a new century bifurcated by wealth, a society run by dynasties, and the elimination of the middle class. Among other things, that is a formula for social upheaval or worse. 

How can Capitalism 2.0 improve transparency? Governments could make everything transparent on the Web and let citizens and other parties contribute their data and observations. They could also let citizens help enforce regulations, perhaps by changing their buying behavior or by organizing public campaigns that name and shame off enders 

Around what should every institution be reinvented? Around the social model for innovation, interdependence, sustainability, and integrity. 

What other names are valid for “Collaborative models”? These models have names such as global action networks, multistakeholder networks, global alliances, and stakeholder webs. 

What do those Collaborative models include? The models include some combination of the four “pillars” of society: the state, the private sector, the civil society, and now empowered individuals 

What is the problem with the leaders of the old model of capitalism? That they are tenaciously clinging to the past and hoping that things will get back to normal. The upshot is that the forces of change—especially today’s young people—may have to find more extreme methods to achieve a new future. 

What kind of government leader is needed under Capitalism 2.0? Those who are focused on real digitally enabled change rather than personal power. These leaders must also see citizens as active participants in democracy rather than passive spectators.
