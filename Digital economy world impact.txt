## Digital economy: world impact 
In the 1990s, economic changes were linked mainly with arrival of the Internet, and this continues as a base for growth of the digital economy, but throughout the 2000s and 2010s a sequence of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) has diffused and underpinned economic change. The digital economy is growing fast, especially in developing countries. With the nonstop connectivity, it has come to much of humankind thanks to smartphones and the resulting access to data, social networks and shifting media amusement. The speeding up of the digital realm has made the use of tools and products employing of gadgets and applications utilizing cloud computing, big data an ICT.
But how come we can measure the growth of such immense economy; it is definitely not an easy job nor without its complications. The bad news is that there are no specific measures of the digital economy as just defined, but the measures that are available give some sense of overall size. The foundational minimum is set by measures of the digital (IT/ICT) sector; for example, that it represented c.6% of OECD value added in 2012 and 2013 or that it represented c.US$3.5tn or c.4.5% of global GDP in 2015.  GDP percentages for developing countries are likely to be around one-third to one-half of OECD/global figures, based on other data such as that given below [1]. 
There are countless approaches in which the digital revolution is changing business models. Most businesses use at least some ICTs.  In 2019, on average 93% of enterprises in OECD countries had a broadband connection. Higher perception has also reduced the difference between large and small firms into less than 7% points. Virtually all large firms (98% on average in the OECD) and more than 91% of small firms are now connected to broadband.  The digitalization of business will continue apace [1]. This will be facilitated by technological developments 
such as the rollout of 5G networks and increasing connectivity of objects through the Internet of 
Things (IoT).
Among large firms, in over half the 25 countries for which data are available, more than one-third analyzed big data. Between 2015 and 2017, the share of enterprises performing BDA increased in most countries [2]. The growth was significant among large firms and to a lesser extent medium-sized firm. It was particularly vigorous among large firms in Germany, France, Finland and Portugal.
ICT implementation and control by business can be carried in a wide variety of ways. Policy objectives reported in the survey differ greatly and are often set out in broad terms. Most often policies are absorbed by firms with aims relating implicitly or explicitly to boosting firms’ profitability. These touch areas such as increasing sales, enhancing competitiveness, lessening operating costs, decreasing compliance costs, and improving productivity [1]. 
Sectors as diverse as retail, logistics and education have changed and keep changing due to the spread of ICT. For retail, the digital economy has enabled retailers to allow customers to place online orders and has made it easier for retailers to gather and analyze data on customers, to provide personalized service and advertising. Transport and Logistics; it has enabled the tracking of both vehicles and cargo across continents, the provision of information to customers and facilitates the development of new operational processes. Financial Services; increasingly enable customers to manage their finances, conduct transactions and access new products online, although they still continue to support branch networks for operations. Better use of data also allows growth in  customer  insights  and  associated  products,  such  as  personalized and lastly, education; as the digital economy spreads, universities, tutor  services  and  other  education  service  providers  are  able  to  provide  courses remotely without the need for face to face interaction through technologies  such  as  video  conferencing  and  streaming  and  online  collaboration portals, which enables them to tap into global demand and leverage brands in a way not previously possible [3].
Digital economy growth rates everywhere are faster than the total economy growth, so the digital economy is growing as a proportion of the overall economy – with current growth rates particularly high in the global South. For example, the Internet economy in the G20 is said to be “growing at 10% a year – significantly faster than the overall G20 economy. The growth is even higher in developing economies, at 15-25% annually”. Looking at specific or related elements, the fastest growth of e-commerce is in the global South, the fastest growth of cross-border links is in emerging economies and main growth in the mobile sector is coming from the global South.

## Questions
What are the driving forcers behind the emergence of technology? the driving forces behind this emergence are economic and political, but they of course also have roots in technological innovation
What kind of succession of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) has been diffused and underpinned economic change? the embedding of connected sensors into more and more objects (the Internet of things); new end-user devices (mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, netbooks, laptops, 3D printers); new digital models (cloud computing, digital platforms, digital services); growing intensity of data usage through spread of big data, data analytics and algorithmic decision-making; and new automation and robotics technologies
What kind of digital affordances is arising from these technologies? potential actions an individual or organization with a purpose can undertake with a digital system within the context of the environment within which they function
How can the impact of any technology can be understood? It can be understood as the product of its scale of diffusion and depth of effect
Mention some examples of the emergence of new economic processes, systems and sectors. Uber (world’s largest “taxi” company), Facebook (world’s most popular media company), Alibaba (world’s biggest and most valuable retailer) and Airbnb (world’s largest “hotelier”)
Approximately how many ICT’s use companies? The  large  majority  of  businesses  use  at  least  some  ICTs.
Why are dangers of adverse incorporation into the digital economy? due to liminality (lack of resources, capabilities, institutions, relations); specific volatility of developing country digital enterprises; and marginalization of developing country workers within any strengthening of digital labor driven from and for the global North.
According to different authors, what is digital economy? The term “information economy” has come to mean the broad, long-term trend toward the expansion of information- and knowledge- based assets and value relative to the tangible assets and products associated with agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. The term “digital economy” refers specifically to the recent and still largely unrealized transformation of all sectors of the economy by the computer-enabled digitization of information.
What do most of author agree with digital economy? All definitions give some acknowledgement that digital technologies of some kind are the foundation for the digital economy.
What is Resource Perspective? most obviously this rests on a technology perspective with many definitions identifying the technologies on which the digital economy is founded; but some include a content perspective that typically relates to the handling of data or information, and a human resource perspective that goes further to incorporate human knowledge or creativity or skills that are enabled by ICTs
What is Process/Flow Perspective? many definitions cover the use of technologies to support particular business processes such as transactions/commerce, while a few acknowledge the new flows of data or information that are enabled by ICTs.  This would include talking about the changes to processes that are occurring.
What is Structural Perspective? It may be rather generic in talking about economic transformation or more specific in identifying the new web/network-based structures that emerge as part of the digital economy.
What is Business Model Perspective? lying between the process and structural perspectives, are the few definitions that bring in the idea of the new business models that are being enabled e.g. those that mention e-business or e-commerce or digital platforms.
Mention some approaches in which the digital revolution is changing business models. Most businesses use at least some ICTs.  In 2019, on average 93% of enterprises in OECD countries had a broadband connection. Higher perception has also reduced the difference between large and small firms into less than 7% points. Virtually all large firms (98% on average in the OECD) and more than 91% of small firms are now connected to broadband.  The digitalization of business will continue apace
Where usually are directed the policies? Most often policies are directed at firms with aims relating implicitly or explicitly to enhancing firms’ profitability.
What other technologies besides Artificial intelligence are mostly mentions regarding advances in digital economy? 5G, IoT, blockchain, robotics, quantum technologies.
What is the problem with defining a measurement of the growth of digital economy? the definitions of “digital economy” are various and differing.  This does not per se make measurement difficult but it makes comparisons difficult.  And definitions with a blurred boundary between the digital economy and the rest of the economy make measurement difficult.
What is the data quality problems with the measurement of digital economy? at present, particularly in developing countries, foundational data problems exist data is absent or of poor quality.  This is exacerbated by continuous innovation, which means data gathering is always behind the curve of technological change (ibid.).
What kind of problems with price exist regarding digital economy? Moore’s Law and its ilk – “my watch has more computing power than the Apollo 11 moon mission” – mean constantly falling prices for the same amount of ICT power, storage, etc.  And the same may be true for ICT-enabled services, which also see qualitative changes that price may not reflect, and the availability of free items (think Wikipedia) that nonetheless add economic value.  Corrections have to be made to account for this, but these are not an exact science.
What is the problem with Digital economy invisibility? many digitally enabled economic activities do not readily appear as output.  They may be intermediate services between business or between consumers; it may be difficult to price inputs so making it hard to calculate value-added; and being often virtual, they are hard to track no least in relation to cross-border digital trade4 and digital consumers-as-producers.
