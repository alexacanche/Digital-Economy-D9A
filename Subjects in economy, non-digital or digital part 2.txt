### Public acceptance of the technology
Technological advances are continuing to be part of the trajectory of evolving civilization. The quest for knowledge and scientific enquiry has driven humanity to explore developments in science and apply them to human requirements and needs.
Public rejection of technologies has frequently resulted in undesirable consequences for the commercialization of technologies. Unpredicted events and accidents affecting the public have acted as a signal which has resulted in fear and reluctance to embrace particular technologies and lead to user rejection of the products of these technologies. As a case in point, the Three Mile Island accident sparked controversy and public negativity towards nuclear technology. Another example is the market introduction of the first generation of genetically modified (GM) food crops, which led to polarized GM food debate internationally. The intensive societal discussion that followed was detrimental for the adoption and commercialization of GM crops and food products at least in some regions of the world. 
Occurrence of such events and controversies over the use of technology, emphasize the importance of public acceptance in strategic development, application, and commercialization of technologies [1].
### Impact of social networks on information and communication tech (ICT) 
People around the world are hastily taking part in virtual form of communication in their everyday lives. The suitability of the networks is technology-mediated contrasting the social communities discovered in the physical world that requires face-to-face contact. Digital social networking sites are controlled and borders within the internet. The swift advance of online network is changing interpersonal relationships with a swing to the digital world altering scenery of social communities from the physical to the digital realm and evolving opposing views in cultivating and maintaining online social connectedness that befits face-to-face relationships. 
However, media networking site affects social, emotional, and cognitive development of youth accounting for a large portion of their time. Among the online application that has grown rapidly in prevalence and popularity in recent years, are Internet-based and permits users to post profile information. Sending public and private online messages as well as sharing photos online while communicating with other users reveals their personal information to unknown users [2].  
The rapid growth of online social networking site embodies an alternative communication platform that require for further research. Social networking dominant all form of communication over the internet.
### Skills for the use of ICT in work and life.
Given their role in the recent transformation of advanced economies, information and communication technologies (ICTs) offer the promise of new business and employment opportunities along with higher productivity profits, but also create new challenges on skills. 
By its nature, IT work demands individuals to master classified and tacit knowledge, which are acquired through various forms such as education and work experience. Even for non-IT workers, ICTs are impacting the skills necessary and the nature and organization of work. Overall, the quick growth of ICT industries and the extensive distribution of ICTs are drastically altering skill sets and occupations, and it is important to gain a better understanding of the employment patterns of this new IT workforce, plus new types of compensation, and new types of jobs.
Surveys from countries such as the United States, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom concur with the finding that IT firms tend to seek a combination of three main types of skills: technical skills: primarily IT, but also quantitative analysis/data modelling, digital media, technical writing, etc. Business/management skills: in marketing, strategy and business writing and personal skills: communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving ability [3].
### The existing regulation in Employment, Ethics, politics and the data science related regulation.
The awareness that data science and its algorithms have a heightened and fundamental effect on society is deep around the world. There is current or starting to debate in many countries and organizations in legal and political context [4]. 
The first data science application recognized to have a large impact on societal processes are election forecasts and polls on voting behavior. Many countries have hence guidelines on what is permitted to make public when in context of a forthcoming or continuing elections. 
Not everyone would agree that data scientists need more guidance how to make moral decisions in their professional life: many do work in companies with codes of conduct, work for institutions that require some vow, or are members of scientific societies that give ethical guidelines to their members or have religious beliefs that give guidance to wrong or right in their life, and there is the fundamentally skeptical view that paper does not blush.
### Security strategies and their regulation
With expanding e-commerce, outsourcing and the digital app economy, there has also been a growing need for data protection legislation. Legislation such as GDPR aims to protect personal data through means of transparency, data controller responsibility, individual rights and security [5]. 
Individual rights such as the Consumer Data Right and the right to data portability in GDPR open the opportunity to break online monopolies, by ensuring that consumers can change providers without necessarily having to start from scratch. This ensures that broken trust in a specific service provider does not necessarily translate into a choice between staying or completely rejecting the service, but rather gives the option to choose a different provider, without suffering penalties
### Regulatory framework and institutions that affect the digital economy.
Accordingly, this evolution of the digital economy is something for regulatory frameworks to welcome and boost, and it demands both policies that indorse the deployment of broadband infrastructure, and a positive environment in which the services, applications, and content reachable over those conveniences can succeed. It is hence vital for regulatory frameworks and policies to encourage investment, innovation and new ways of bringing services to all components of this communications ecosystem.   
Designing a regulatory framework that reflects the value of the entire digital communications and services landscape should be a strategic priority. This means integrating a regulatory impact assessment approach, in which proposed regulatory objectives are clearly defined, and the full range of historical, current, and emerging risks are carefully analyzed relative to their impact on the desired objectives. From this perspective, regulators are better placed to introduce sufficiently flexible policies that support investment and innovation for all the players in that ecosystem. By doing so, regulators can enable and promote a strong economy through a robust global digital ecosystem as a platform for innovation, competition, and economic growth today and in the years to come [6].

### Questions 
What is data? information that has been stored in digital form (though data is not limited to information that has been digitized and data management principles apply to data captured on paper as well as in databases).
Difference between data and information? Data has been called the “raw material of information” and information has been called “data in context”
What does a data-driven company mean? Being data-driven includes the recognition that data must be managed efficiently and with professional discipline, through a partnership of business leadership and technical expertise.
Why is important data quality within the company? Organizations manage their data because they want to use it. If they cannot rely on it to meet business needs, then the effort to collect, store, secure, and enable access to it is wasted. To ensure data meets business needs, they must work with data consumers to define these needs, including characteristics that make data of high quality.
What is the data lifecycle? It includes processes that create or obtain data, those that move, transform, and store it and enable it to be maintained and shared, and those that use or apply it, as well as those that dispose of it.
What should include a data strategy? A data strategy should include business plans to use information to competitive advantage and support enterprise goals. Data strategy must come from an understanding of the data needs inherent in the business strategy: what data the organization needs, how it will get the data, how it will manage it and ensure its reliability over time, and how it will utilize it.
What is the Strategic Alignment Model? abstracts the fundamental drivers for any approach to data management. At its center is the relationship between data and information. Information is most often associated with business strategy and the operational use of data.
What is the DAMA Wheel? It places data governance at the center of data management activities, since governance is required for consistency within and balance between the functions. The other Knowledge Areas (Data Architecture, Data Modeling, etc.) are balanced around the Wheel. They are all necessary parts of a mature data management function, but they may be implemented at different times, depending on the requirements of the organization.
What are the three core concepts of the ethics of data handling? Impact on people,potential for misuse, and economic value of data.
What is Data Handling Ethics? Data handling ethics are concerned with how to procure, store, manage, interpret, analyze/apply and dispose of data in ways that are aligned with ethical principles, including community responsibility.
What are the Ethical Principles for Data? Respect for Persons, beneficence and justice.
What does include the  Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines? limitations on data collection; an expectation that data will be of high quality; the requirement that when data is collected, it is done for a specific purpose; limitations on data usage; security safeguards; an expectation of openness and transparency; the right of an individual to challenge the accuracy of data related to himself or herself; and accountability for organizations to follow the guidelines.
Mention at least on principle for online data? Ownership of data: The rights to control one’s personal data in relation to social media sites and databrokers. Downstream aggregators of personal data can embed data into deep profiles that individuals arenot aware of.
What are Misleading Visualizations? Charts and graphs can be used to present data in a misleading manner. For instance, changing scale can make a trend line look better or worse. Leaving data points out, comparing two facts without clarifying their relationship, or ignoring accepted visual conventions (such as that the numbers in a pie chart representing percentages must add up to 100 and only 100), can also be used to trick people into interpreting visualizations in ways that are not supported by the data itself.
Explain the Biased sampling methodology. Sampling is often a necessary part of data collection. But bias can be introduced by the method used to select the sample set. It is virtually impossible for humans to sample without bias of some sort. To limit bias, use statistical tools to select samples and establish adequate sample sizes. Awareness of bias in data sets used for training is particularly important.
What is Data Governance? is defined as the exercise of authority and control (planning, monitoring, and enforcement) over the management of data assets.
What is the aim of Data Governance? Data Governance must set standards and policies for and provide oversight of data handling practices. Employees must expect fair handling, protection from reporting possible breaches, and non-interference in their personal lives.
What is Issue management? Identifying, defining, escalating, and resolving issues related to data security, data access, data quality, regulatory compliance, data ownership, policy, standards, terminology, or data governance procedures.
What is the most common driver for data governance? is often regulatory compliance, especially for heavily regulated industries, such as financial services and healthcare.
What does data drivers focus on? Drivers for data governance most often focus on reducing risks or improving processes
Difference between Data Governance and IT governance? IT governance makes decisions about IT investments, the IT application portfolio, and the IT project portfolio – in other words, hardware, software, and overall technical architecture. In contrast, Data Governance focuses exclusively on the management of data assets and of data as an asset.
What does the sustainable principal id data Governance mean? DG necessitates changes in how data is managed and used. This does not always mean massive new organizations and upheaval. It does mean managing change in a way that is sustainable beyond the initial implementation of any data governance component. Sustainable data governance depends on business leadership, sponsorship, and ownership.
What is a data-centric organization? A data-centric organization values data as an asset and manages data through all phases of its lifecycle, including project development and ongoing operations.
What is a Business/DG strategy map? This map connects DG activity with business needs. Periodically measuring and communicating how DG is helping the business is vital to obtain ongoing support for the program.
