## Subjects in economy, non-digital or digital
### Describe trends in AI uses as mainstream in efficiency and productivity gains.
Artificial intelligence is concept that implies to any sort of computer software that employs in humanlike activities, including learning, planning and problem-solving. Forrester Research's report In 2021 notes that AI acceptance grew by 15% through 2020 [1]. 
It is well known that growth in technical change is a function of profit implementation as well as the of extension of output in the long-term. The extension of output is positive (negative) if there are increasing (decreasing) returns to scale. We can compute the profit deployment linked to AI which averages between 5% and 12% depending on the industry. Consequently, total relative productivity change between adopting and non-adopting firms could be large and could be even higher if one believes that economies of scale can emerge out of AI [2]. Along with the internet of things, artificial intelligence has the potential to dramatically remake the economy, but its exact impact remains to be seen.
### Automation and augmentation of work with machine learning algorithms.
Advances in artificial intelligence are gradually leading to the automation and augmentation of decision processes in work contexts. Even though research originally centered upon decision-makers, the viewpoint of those aimed by automated or augmented decisions and parties who observe the effects of such decisions is now increasing in significance and interest [3]. 
Research in automated and augmented decision-making has focused principally upon first parties [4]. In our highly connected society, second and third parties can be exceptionally influential on organizations considering the implementation of systems enabling the automation or augmentation of decisions; understanding second-hand third-party responses has never been more critical as society continues its march towards automation and augmentation. 
### Characteristics of big data and cloud computing
Big Data it is usually explained with the five V’s; volume, describes the size of datasets that a big data system deals with. Variety concerns the different types of data from various sources that big data frameworks have to deal with; velocity concerns the different rates at which data streams may get in or out the system. Value concerns the potential value of the data regarding the information they contain and lastly, veracity refers to the trustworthiness of the data [5].
Cloud computing provides an easy way to get resources, offering scalability and availability. Cloud providers usually offer three different basic services: IaaS, delivers infrastructure, which means storage, processing power, and virtual machines. PaaS, is built atop of IaaS and allows users to deploy cloud applications created using the programming and run-time environments supported by the provider. SaaS, consists of applications running directly in the cloud provider.  
### What is Blockchain?
A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or                               digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. As a specialized type of decentralized ledger technology (DLT), blockchains store encrypted data across peer-to-peer networks, linking together sequential “blocks” of information into “chains”. The information available to all network participants is a shared ledger of all information transactions on the blockchain. The consensus algorithms ensure that information is consistent and immutable across this decentralized network and deter individual users from adding to ledger information without authorization from the network. Furthermore, due to blockchain’s structure, prior information on the chain cannot be edited or removed, as doing so would compromise the integrity of the decentralized ledger [6].
### What is Hyperledger
Hyperledger is a collaboration of the Linux Foundation's open source blockchains to promote the shared creation of distributed blockchain ledgers. The project aims to promote cross-industrial cooperation through the creation of blockchains and distributed leads, in particular improving systems efficiency and reliability. There are already five Hyperledger company blockchains. Factory, Iroha, Burrow, Sawtooth, Indy [7].
### Financial transactions
The study of financial transactions, which describe the exchange of money flows, available at different instants and subject to quantitative variations over time, correspond to the joint field of mathematics and finance. The evident importance of the analysis of financial transactions, both in the field of financial mathematics and its application at the social level, reveal the need for research to provide analytical solutions. It is also relevant that the traditional methods applied in financial transactions lack flexibility and are not adapted to the needs of the client in an unequal and unstable society; for these reasons, the financial sector requires adaptation to the new situations that are generated in this new economic and social scenario.
## Digital currencies
The ongoing digital revolution may lead to a radical departure from the traditional model of monetary exchange. We may see an unbundling of the separate roles of money, creating fiercer competition among specialized currencies. Digitalization has revolutionized money and payments systems. Although digital money itself is not new to modern economies, digital currencies now facilitate instantaneous peer-to-peer transfers of value in a way that was previously impossible. New currencies will emerge as the central lynchpins of large, systemically important social and economic platforms that transcend national borders, redefining the ways in which payments and users’ data interact. The advent of these new monies could reshape the nature of currency competition, the architecture of the international monetary system, and the role of government-issued public money [8].
### Technical obstacles and political challenges (like bitcoin in El Salvador country)
The acceleration in the issuance of CBDCs is likely to impact both how the commercial banking sector is used to implement monetary policy as well as its pivotal role in moving and storing value. Monetary policy and financial supervision need to be revised internationally to acknowledge these changes and to mitigate potential negative impacts.
Many Caribbean countries have long endeavored to increase national participation in the digital economy. In the case of Trinidad and Tobago, for example, formal efforts to improve the legislative and technological infrastructure to facilitate e-commerce date back to 1999 (National Electronic Commerce Policy Committee, 2000). In the ensuing fifteen years, however, progress has been slow, and the challenge continues to engage the attention of national authorities. There is need for a more effective enabling environment that supports the efforts of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to provide e-commerce services. The sector has therefore yet to grow to its potential. Among the greatest challenges the e-commerce sector has faced, both in Trinidad and Tobago, and throughout the Caribbean subregion, are difficulties surrounding banking and the use of electronic payment systems [9].
